The Rafael Python is a family of air-to-air missiles (AAMs) built by the Israeli weapons manufacturer Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, formerly RAFAEL Armament Development Authority. 
The development of the rocket was started in 1978 by Rafael , the Shafrir-2 rocket was taken for the basics , and it was also originally called Shafrir 3. The main improvement was the new all-track GOS with increased sensitivity, viewing angle and the ability to screen out false targets.

In 1981, rocket tests began in the IDF .
In 1982, the rocket was adopted by the Israeli Air Force , and in the same year, it proved itself well in the operation "Peace Galilee" - during the battle in the Bekaa Valley in 1982, this rocket destroyed approximately 50 enemy aircraft.
The length was 3 m. The rocket could receive information from the on-board radar of the carrier aircraft or operate in the scanning and aiming mode along the longitudinal axis. The maximum target tracking angle is 30 ° before launch, and 40 ° during the flight. Maximum overload during maneuvering is 40 g. The range of application is up to 5 km at low altitude, and up to 15 km at medium altitudes. The minimum range of application is 0.5 km.

The Python-3 is a much-improved AAM with all-aspect attack ability, higher speed, range, and performance. It performed well before and during the 1982 Lebanon War, scoring 35 (other sources claim 50) kills.
China's PLAAF was quite impressed with this missile, and paid for licensed production as the PL-8 AAM in the 1980s.


It was used on F-4 Phantom II, F-5 Tiger II, F-15 Eagle , F-16 Fighting Falcon , IAI Kfir (namely Kfir C.2 ), all types of Mirage (including Mirage III and Mirage F.1, J -7, J-8.
The rocket was exported to China, Romania, South Africa and Thailand.
