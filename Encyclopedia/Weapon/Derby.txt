Rafael I-Derby Missile
-----------------------
Also known as the Alto, the Derby missile is a BVR, medium-range (~50 km) active-radar seeker missile. 
Though technically not part of the "Python" family, the missile is basically an enlarged Python-4 with an active-radar seeker
It is a rocket of the "run and forget" type. Can hit enemy aircraft day and night, in any weather. Can be aimed at the target both before and after launch. It is executed on aerodynamic scheme "duck" and is largely unified with a Python-4 rocket . Can be aimed at the target both before and after launch. There is an active radar homing head. The combat unit is high-explosive fragmentation.
Used to arm the F-16C / D, F-5, Mirage, JAS-39 Gripen, and possibly MiG-21.
In addition to aircraft, Derby along with Python-5 is used in the Spydercomplex .
In 2001, Derby was first demonstrated at the air show in Le Bourget.
